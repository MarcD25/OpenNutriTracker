# Calendar and Weight Tab Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the calendar dot system and the addition of a dedicated Weight tab.

## âœ… Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Calendar Dot System**

**Previous System:**
- Single large scale icon below dates
- Border highlighting around check-in days
- Not very visible or intuitive

**New System:**
- **Two-dot system** positioned at the bottom center of each date
- **First dot (Left)**: Calorie intake indicator
  - **Green**: Good calorie intake (within goal range)
  - **Red**: Over/under eating (outside goal range)
  - Only appears when there are actual food entries with calories > 0
- **Second dot (Right)**: Weight check-in indicator
  - **Solid Blue**: Check-in day where user has weighed in
  - **Light Blue (40% opacity)**: Check-in day where user hasn't weighed in yet
  - Only appears on designated check-in days

**Visual Layout:**
```
    [Date Number]
        â€¢ â€¢
   [Food] [Weight]
```

### 2. **New Weight Tab**
