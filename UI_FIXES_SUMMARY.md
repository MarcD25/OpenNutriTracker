# UI/UX Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Weight Check-in Days Not Visible in Calendar ✅
**Problem**: Weight check-in days were not clearly visible in the calendar view.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the calendar's `defaultBuilder` to show check-in days with a colored border and background
- Added a small scale icon in the top-right corner of check-in days
- Improved the visual contrast by increasing the alpha value of the background color
- Fixed the calendar navigation to properly load check-in days when changing months

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/features/diary/presentation/widgets/diary_table_calendar.dart`

### 2. Calendar Navigation Arrows Not Working ✅
**Problem**: Calendar arrows kept users in the same month instead of navigating properly.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the `onPageChanged` callback to properly trigger parent updates
- Added proper date selection callback when navigating between months
- Ensured check-in days are reloaded when changing months

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/features/diary/presentation/widgets/diary_table_calendar.dart`

### 3. Confusing Calorie Display (2101 vs 2738) ✅
**Problem**: Main display showed "kcal left" (2101) while bottom section showed all values as 2738, causing confusion.

**Solution**:
- Added explanatory text in the Net Calorie Tracking section
- Clarified that the main circle shows calories left from daily goal
- Explained that the bottom section shows total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)
- Made the distinction between "calories left to eat" vs "total energy expenditure" clearer

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/features/home/presentation/widgets/dashboard_widget.dart`

### 4. Calorie Adjustment Buttons Not Working ✅
**Problem**: Preset buttons in the calorie adjustment dialog didn't update the slider value.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the StatefulBuilder implementation to properly manage dialog state
- Replaced the broken `setState` callback with a proper function parameter
- Updated preset buttons to use a callback function that updates the dialog state
- Ensured slider and preset buttons are synchronized

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/features/settings/presentation/widgets/calorie_adjustment_widget.dart`

### 5. Copy to Another Day Not Working ✅
**Problem**: The copy functionality for food entries wasn't working properly.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the date picker with better labels and confirmation text
- Added proper error handling and success feedback
- Improved the callback chain to ensure copy operations complete successfully
- Added SnackBar notifications for success/failure feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/features/diary/presentation/widgets/food_entry_actions.dart`

## Technical Improvements

### Calendar System
- Enhanced check-in day visibility with better visual indicators
- Fixed month navigation to properly update focused dates

### User Interface
- Added explanatory text to reduce confusion about calorie displays
- Improved button interactions with proper state management
- Enhanced feedback mechanisms with success/error notifications

### Error Handling
